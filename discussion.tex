This section addresses some possible concerns related to \Cheetah{}. 

\paragraph{Hardware Dependence.} \cheetah{} is an approach that relies on the hardware PMU unit to sample memory accesses. To use \cheetah{}, users should setup the driver to enable the PMU-based sampling beforehand. After that, they can connect to the \cheetah{} library by calling only two APIs: one API is to setup PMU-based registers and another one is to handle every sampled memory access, with less than 5 lines of code change of \cheetah{}. 
%Users should add PMU initialization at startup of a program or in the beginning of every thread, with adding less than 5 lines of code in total. 
%Currently, we have implemented the hardware support for the AMD Opteron machine and will add the support for Intel PEBS-related machines. 

\paragraph{Performance Overhead.} On average, \Cheetah{} only introduces 7\% performance overhead for all evaluated applications. However, \cheetah{} does introduce more than 20\% overhead for two applications (with a large number of threads) because \cheetah{} should setup hardware registers for every thread. But this should not be a big concern of using \cheetah{}. First, creating a large number of threads in an application is not normal. Second, we expect to only setup once with better hardware support. We also expect that the overhead can be further reduced by only sampling memory accesses, but not non-related instructions such as arithmetic instructions and logic instructions.  \cheetah{} may further reduce the performance overhead with better hardware support in the future.

\paragraph{Effectiveness.} \Cheetah{} effectively detects false sharing problems that occur in the current execution and have high impact on the performance. For the effective detection, \Cheetah{} requires programs to run sufficiently long, maybe more than few seconds. This should not be a problem for long-running applications, the main target of optimizations.
