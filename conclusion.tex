\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we present \cheetah{}, a lightweight profiler that identifies false sharing in multithreaded programs. \cheetah{} distinguishes true and false sharing, and only reports the false sharing that significantly impacts the whole program performance. In addition, \cheetah{} quantifies the optimization potentials after the optimization. Moreover, \cheetah{} provides insightful guidance in the source code, including data objects and accesses involved in the false sharing, for fixing the problem. Experimental results show that \cheetah{} can successfully identify false sharing in well-known benchmarks and gives accurate assessment to the optimization potentials.

%Our future work is three folds. First, we will provide a graphic user interface to present the analysis in a user-friendly way. Second, we plan to extend \cheetah{} to handle managed languages, such as JAVA and Python. Third, we will extend \cheetah{} to automatically fix the false sharing problem without the requirement of any manual effort.
