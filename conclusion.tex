\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we present \cheetah{}, a lightweight profiler that identifies false sharing in multithreaded programs. \cheetah{} is the first tool that can quantify the optimization potential, without the need of actually fixing a problem. For false sharing detection, \cheetah{} distinguishes true and false sharing, and only reports problems that can significantly impact the whole program performance. \cheetah{} provides insightful guidance for fixing problems. Experimental results show that \cheetah{} can successfully identify serious false sharing problems and accurately assess the potential performance gain of each problem. \Cheetah{} is ready for real deployment, which is available for download at http://github.com/XXXXX.

%Our future work is three folds. First, we will provide a graphic user interface to present the analysis in a user-friendly way. Second, we plan to extend \cheetah{} to handle managed languages, such as JAVA and Python. Third, we will extend \cheetah{} to automatically fix the false sharing problem without the requirement of any manual effort.
