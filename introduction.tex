Multicore processors are ubiquitous, from phones, desktops, to high-end servers.When multiple tasks, running on different cores with private L1 caches, access logically independent words in the same cache line, unnecessary synchronizations caused by false sharing can dramatically degrade the performance of parallel software by up to an order of magnitude, shown in Figure~\ref{}. The hardware trend, including adding more cores into the same machine, introducing the Non-Uniform-Memory-Access (NUMA) architecture, or increasing the size of a cache line, will further degrade the performance of false sharing problems, making the task of detecting more urgent.
