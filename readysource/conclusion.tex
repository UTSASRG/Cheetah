\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper presents \cheetah{}, a lightweight profiler that identifies false sharing in multithreaded programs. \cheetah{} employs the first approach that quantifies the optimization potentials of fixing false sharing instances, without actual fixes. For detection, \cheetah{} distinguishes true and false sharing, and only reports problems that significantly impact overall program performance. \cheetah{} provides insightful guidance for fixing problems while only introducing 7\% runtime overhead, making it ready for real deployment. 
%Experimental results show that \cheetah{} can successfully identify serious false sharing problems and accurately assess the potential performance gain of each instance, with $\sim$7\% performance overhead. \Cheetah{} is ready for real deployment.

%Our future work is three folds. First, we will provide a graphic user interface to present the analysis in a user-friendly way. Second, we plan to extend \cheetah{} to handle managed languages, such as JAVA and Python. Third, we will extend \cheetah{} to automatically fix the false sharing problem without the requirement of any manual effort.
